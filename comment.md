Where I am left?

I was trying to map all posts by category but had some problems when it comes to making pagination for filtered posts. There is no way to do that with API (at least I thought so)

Need to find a way to make it work. For now, I left it with all posts being mapped but it should be changed

UPDATE: found out a way to do that. Now everything is working fine.
